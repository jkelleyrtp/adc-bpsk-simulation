## Abstract


In this paper, we leverage introductory-level skills in analog-digital communication (ADC) to design an end-to-end communication system in Simulink. The Simulink model of the system was used to then select appropriate physical component, drive a schematic design, and inform a printed circuit board (PCB) layout of a potential hardware implementation. The ADC system model was designed to use Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) as the modulation scheme and optimized to fit within a handful of real-world constraints including power limitations, transmission rate, error rate, and availability of components for the hardware implementation. The final result of the Simulink model demonstrated the capability for a transmitter and receiver to send digital messages to one another utilizing fully-capable MAC and PHY layers.

This project served as a excellent demonstration of introductory ADC skills and helped better inform and relate these skills to real-world system design.
